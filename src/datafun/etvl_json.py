"""etvl_json.py - JSON ETVL pipeline.

Author: Denise Case
Date: 2026-08-23

Practice key Python skills related to:
    - ETVL pipeline structure (Extract, Transform, Verify, Load)
    - reading JSON files using the json module
    - walking JSON: dictionaries, lists, and nested structures
    - keyword-only function arguments
    - defensive programming for untrusted input
    - runtime type checking with isinstance()
    - writing results to a text file

OBS:
  This file is part of the working example project.
  First, run and understand the example as provided.
  When you take ownership of the project, adapt this pipeline
  to process data for your new problem.

RUN:
  No need.
  We don't usually run supporting modules like this one directly.

# === SKILL: JSON DATA STRUCTURE ===

# JSON is a common format for exchanging data over the web.
# Python's json module reads JSON into native Python types:
#
#   JSON object  / Python dict   { "key": value }
#   JSON array   / Python list   [ value, value ]
#   JSON string  / Python str    "hello"
#   JSON number  / Python int or float
#   JSON boolean / Python bool   true / True
#   JSON null    / Python None
#
# JSON is hierarchical: lists and dicts can be nested inside each other.
# Example:
#   {
#     "people": [
#       { "name": "Oleg Kononenko", "craft": "ISS" },
#       { "name": "Jasmin Moghbeli", "craft": "ISS" }
#     ]
#   }
#
# json.load(file) returns the top-level structure - usually a dict.
# Use dict.get(key, default) to safely access keys that may be missing.


# === SKILL: DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING FOR UNTRUSTED INPUT ===

# JSON is untrusted input: keys may be missing, values may be wrong types.
# Never assume a key exists. Never assume a value is the expected type.
# Use isinstance() to check types at runtime before using a value.
# Use dict.get(key, default) to handle missing keys without crashing.


# === E: EXTRACT ===
